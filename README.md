We want YOU for Java Development
================================
This repository is meant to be a launch point for Javascript developers who want
to get into Java development.

## Why Java?
Java has been one of the most popular languages for large scale
enterprise solutions for a very long time. The JDK (the environment where Java
code gets run) is very mature that comes with a lot of powerful tools. Java
code can execute on any machine that has Java installed and it is also the
de facto language for writing Android apps. Good Java developers are eternally
in demand and can be paid very well.

Java is a very different language from Javascript. It is meant to solve a different
set of problems, so the environment that you work will potentially feel unfamiliar.
On top of that, Java absolutely *revolves* around OOP concepts. There are core
ideas that are going to feel unfamiliar to you in the beginning and I want you
to know that it's absolutely OK if you read something and don't understand it right
away. Java is complicated and it's impressive that you are trying to learn it.

## How to tackle new languages
Throughout your programming career you will often have to quickly get ramped up
on new technologies. Occasionally this even means picking up and working in a
new language. My personal strategy is to tackle several resources at once; I will
find an entry-level tutorial, maybe watch a video and find an open source project
to cruise through. The entry-level tutorial will teach you syntax, the videos will
teach you how domain experts talk about their language and the open source project
will give you a real world example of the language. Don't get hung up on meticulously
remembering everything you come across; consume the material and move on to the next thing.
The more context that you have the easier it will be to figure out what's important to know.

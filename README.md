We want YOU for Java Development
================================
This repository is meant to be a launch point for Javascript developers who want
to get into Java development.

## Why Java?
Java has been one of the most popular languages for large scale
enterprise solutions for a very long time. The JDK (the environment where Java
code gets run) is very mature that comes with a lot of powerful tools. Java
code can execute on any machine that has Java installed and it is also the
de facto language for writing Android apps. Good Java developers are eternally
in demand and can be paid very well.

Java is a very different language from Javascript. It is meant to solve a different
set of problems, so the environment that you work will potentially feel unfamiliar.
On top of that, Java absolutely *revolves* around OOP concepts. There are core
ideas that are going to feel unfamiliar to you in the beginning and I want you
to know that it's OK if you read something and don't understand it right
away. Java is complicated and it's impressive that you are trying to learn it.

## How to tackle new languages
Throughout your programming career you will often have to quickly get ramped up
on new technologies. Occasionally this even means picking up and working in a
new language. My personal strategy is to tackle several resources at once; I will
find an entry-level tutorial, maybe watch a video and find an open source project
to cruise through. The entry-level tutorial will teach you syntax, the videos will
teach you how domain experts talk about their language and the open source project
will give you a real world example of the language. Don't get hung up on meticulously
remembering everything you come across; consume the material and move on to the next thing.
The more context that you have the easier it will be to figure out what's important to know.

### Online Resources
Princeton Tutorial http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/home/
> This is a well written, if dryly presented tutorial series from Princeton. My
favorite thing about this is the amount of example applications they give you. After
each article they provide some creative exercises and multiple choice questions to
help reinforce your knowledge.

Oracle Tutorials https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/
> The Oracle Tutorials. It would be wrong to omit these; they are very comprehensive.
If you were to make it through the entirety of this tutorial series you could walk
into any java shop and get a job. They go over almost every major section of the
standard library. If you plan on getting your java certification, be prepared to
hang out here.

Udemy Course https://www.udemy.com/java-tutorial/
> Udemy is dope. I have not personally taken this course but I have taken other
Java courses and I've always enjoyed them. Udemy is potentially not free but the
content that you get is worth it in my opinion. The first few courses are free, I
would recommend giving them a shot and seeing if you jive with their style. 

Treehouse https://teamtreehouse.com/library/topic:java
> Treehouse is a collection of courses and small, consumable modules that vary
in subject across the JDK. I like Treehouse because it can give you an intro to
almost any subject you can think of; I was surprised to see more than one module
on functional programming in Java. Modules can be organized by several metrics
including difficulty and estimated time to completion.

We want YOU for Java Development
================================
This repository is meant to be a launch point for Javascript developers who want
to get into Java development.

## Why Java?
Java has been one of the most popular languages for large scale
enterprise solutions for a very long time. The JDK (the environment where Java
code gets run) is very mature and it comes with a lot of powerful tools. Java
code can execute on any machine that has Java installed and it is also the
de facto language for writing Android apps. Good Java developers are eternally
in demand and can be paid very well. In addition, libraries and tools are often
shared between languages on the JDK. Learning one language brings you that much
closer to being fluent in another.

Java is a very different language from Javascript. It is meant to solve a different
set of problems which can make it feel unfamiliar and intimidating to Javascript programmers.
On top of that, Java absolutely revolves around OOP concepts. There are core
ideas that are going to feel unfamiliar to you in the beginning and I want you
to know that it's OK if you read something and don't understand it right
away. Java is complicated and it's impressive that you are trying to learn it.

## How to tackle new languages
Throughout your programming career you will often have to quickly get ramped up
on new technologies. Occasionally this even means picking up and working in a
new language. My personal strategy is to tackle several resources at once; I will
find an entry-level tutorial, maybe watch a video and find an open source project
to cruise through. The entry-level tutorial will teach you syntax, the videos will
teach you how domain experts talk about their language and the open source project
will give you a real world example of the language. Don't get hung up on meticulously
remembering everything you come across; consume the material and move on to the
next thing. The more context that you have the easier it will be to figure out
what's important to know now and what you can worry about later.

### Online Resources
Princeton Tutorial http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/home/
> This is a well written, if dryly presented tutorial series from Princeton. My
favorite thing about this is the amount of example applications they give you. After
each article they provide some creative exercises and multiple choice questions to
help reinforce your knowledge.

Oracle Tutorials https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/
> The Oracle Tutorials. It would be wrong to omit these; they are very comprehensive.
If you were to make it through the entirety of this tutorial series you could walk
into any java shop and get a job. They go over almost every major section of the
standard library. If you plan on getting your java certification, be prepared to
hang out here.

Udemy Course https://www.udemy.com/java-tutorial/
> Udemy is dope. I have not personally taken this course but I have taken other
Java courses and I've always enjoyed them. Udemy is potentially not free but the
content that you get is worth it in my opinion. The first few courses are free, I
would recommend giving them a shot and seeing if you jive with their style.

Treehouse https://teamtreehouse.com/library/topic:java
> Treehouse is a collection of courses and small, consumable modules that vary
in subject across the JDK. I like Treehouse because it can give you an intro to
almost any subject you can think of; I was surprised to see more than one module
on functional programming in Java. Modules can be organized by several metrics
including difficulty and estimated time to completion.

### Open Source Projects


### Libraries and Frameworks

Spring https://spring.io/
> Spring is a web framework for Java. Spring is an absolutely massive, opinionated
piece of software that is in use all over the world, and for good reason. Spring
can make your life as a web developer very easy if you know what you are doing.
The first technology I learned after getting my bearings with the Java language
was Spring. If you walk into a job interview and say, "I graduated from a Javascript
bootcamp but I want to do Java. Here is an app that I wrote in Spring Boot." You
will be taken seriously.

### Tools

IntelliJ Community Edition https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/
> IntelliJ is by far the most popular IDE for Java development, and probably
JDK development as a whole. Here is an article telling you why:
https://dzone.com/articles/why-idea-better-eclipse There are so many advantages
to picking IntelliJ over Eclipse, particularly for a student coming out of Prime.
It is made by JetBrains, the same company behind Webstorm and PyCharm (which are
both just trimmed down and specialized versions of IntelliJ) so any knowledge
you have of those will transfer. It has market share, which means that there are
more stack overflow questions and resources to look at if you have trouble.
Just pick IntelliJ.

Eclipse https://eclipse.org/ide/
> If you know 100% that you are going to be doing OSGi development at your next
job and have decided to work there anyway, I would briefly consider getting Eclipse
and then get IntelliJ anyway.

Gradle https://gradle.org/
> Gradle is the build tool of choice for Java. It is the successor to Maven.
Learning Maven or Gradle will probably be one of your first tasks upon getting
hired somewhere; until then, just memorize those names and continue on your
learning adventure.
